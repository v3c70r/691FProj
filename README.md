HOW TO COMPILE
==============

I assume that you are running on X64 linux OS. To compile the code, you have to do following steps:

1. run "make" command to compile Pinnocho library.

2. Type "sh compile.sh" in myMain folder to compile the code.

HOW TO RUN
=============
In my main folder type "sh run.sh test.obj" to run the binary. It will link Pinnocho library for you. Please have your Leap Motion connected before you run the binary.
